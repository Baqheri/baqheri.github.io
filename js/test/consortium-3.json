ZB MED's primary goal is to support researchers and students working in the life sciences arena. To achieve that goal, ZB MED offers literature and specialist information in both digital and print formats – on-site and through its various portals – while constantly striving to enhance and expand the services it offers.\n\nZB MED is a member of the DataCite consortium since its formation in 2009. ZB MED provides several publishing services and promotes open access to textual publications as well as data. It has launched PUBLISSO (http://www.publisso.de/en/) to bring all its activities around open access and open data publishing together. ZB MED offers a DOI registration service for all kinds of digital material from the life sciences, especially the fields of medicine, nutrition and agriculture. In the life sciences, the DOI system is widespread and very well established, and it provides accepted visible proof that a publication is citable. By offering this service, ZB MED facilitates and promotes online publication of scientific texts and data from its fields. Researchers and institutions in these fields interested in DOI registration are invited to contact us.","region":"EMEA","country":"DE","logoUrl":null,"memberType":"consortium","organizationType":"nationalInstitution","focusArea":"medicalAndHealthSciences","nonProfitStatus":"non-profit","isActive":true,"joined":null,"rorId":null,"created":"2020-11-09T14:29:55.000Z","updated":"2022-09-13T23:30:46.000Z","doiEstimate":0},"relationships":{"clients":{"data":[]},"prefixes":{"data":[]},"contacts":{"data":[{"id":"eb4ceb72-e98b-4c8d-9720-0d070fa4c581","type":"contacts"},{"id":"e956eced-6115-4aee-a088-b82a1e24d3d6","type":"contacts"},{"id":"d6808077-29fe-4c84-9676-9fa852f21aaa","type":"contacts"},{"id":"e2c2b0fc-5442-4408-a531-706fbaaed939","type":"contacts"}]},"consortiumOrganizations":{"data":[{"id":"kydj","type":"providers"},{"id":"nicv","type":"providers"},{"id":"wfnq","type":"providers"},{"id":"zypi","type":"providers"},{"id":"zkwt","type":"providers"},{"id":"kgqs","type":"providers"},{"id":"swjb","type":"providers"},{"id":"dzne","type":"providers"}]}}}],"meta":{"total":57,"totalPages":3,"page":3,"years":[{"id":"2023","title":"2023","count":3},{"id":"2022","title":"2022","count":4},{"id":"2021","title":"2021","count":13},{"id":"2020","title":"2020","count":33},{"id":"2019","title":"2019","count":3},{"id":"2018","title":"2018","count":1}],"regions":[{"id":"emea","title":"Europe, Middle East and Africa","count":26},{"id":"amer","title":"Americas","count":17},{"id":"apac","title":"Asia and Pacific","count":4}],"memberTypes":[{"id":"consortium","title":"Consortium","count":57}],"organizationTypes":[{"id":"academicInstitution","title":"Academic Institution","count":16},{"id":"governmentAgency","title":"Government Agency","count":9},{"id":"nationalInstitution","title":"National Institution","count":8},{"id":"serviceProvider","title":"Service Provider","count":6},{"id":"other","title":"Other","count":5},{"id":"researchInstitution","title":"Research Institution","count":3},{"id":"publisher","title":"Publisher","count":1}],"focusAreas":[{"id":"general","title":"General","count":30},{"id":"engineeringAndTechnology","title":"Engineering And Technology","count":4},{"id":"naturalSciences","title":"Natural Sciences","count":3},{"id":"humanities","title":"Humanities","count":2},{"id":"medicalAndHealthSciences","title":"Medical And Health Sciences","count":2},{"id":"socialSciences","title":"Social Sciences","count":2}],"nonProfitStatuses":[{"id":"non-profit","title":"Non Profit","count":53},{"id":"for-profit","title":"For Profit","count":4}],"hasRequiredContacts":[{"id":"true","title":"True","count":57}]},"links":{"self":"./js/test/consortium-3.json"}}
